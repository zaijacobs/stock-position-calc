## Usage

#### Fixed Cash Amount: 
Will calculate the number of shares solely based on the amount you want to invest in a trade.
Example: You have $10,000 to invest in a stock and you would like to buy shares of that stock when the price falls down to $20.
The amount of shares you will buy will be 500 ($10,000 / $20).

#### Fixed Risk:
Will calculate the number of shares based on how much you are willing to risk.
Example: You have an account size of $10,000 and you would like to buy shares of a stock when the price falls down to $20.
You decide on a stop loss of 15% ($17) and you want to risk only 1% ($100) of your account size.
The amount of shares you will buy will be 33 ($100 / ($20 - $17)).
